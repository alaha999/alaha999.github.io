We plan to have 8 sessions to cover the materials offered in this modular course. We may have a guest lecture in the last session.

## Modules
---

- **Week 1**: Basic math of a neural network, Basic python,numpy,pandas
- **Week 2**: Simple regression neural network, testing it and benchmarking performance
- **Week 3**: Simple classification, train/test splits and ROC curves
- **Week 4**: Advanced classification task, Ranking of input variables
- **Week 5**: Convolutional neural networks
- **Week 6**: Examples of unsupervised learning algorithms (clustering)
- **Week 7**: Autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks
- **Week 8**: continue previous discussion and assessment
- **Week 9**: continue previous discussion and assessment
